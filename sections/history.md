### In the beginning (Well, 2004)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>```

![Spring Old](images/spring-old.png)


## And it was great!

Note:
It definitely improved on what was there before

Provided excellent DI


## But...

Note:

Featured lots of XM

Slow development

Slow deployment

Lots of conventions

Lots of configuration

And in the same year...


### Configuration is dead! 
### Long live convention!
### Long live fun programming languages!

![Ruby](images/ruby.png)
![Rails](images/rails.png)


## And it was great!

Note:
Fast CRUD development

Easy deploys

Great library support

Gem install anything!


## But...

Note:
Scaling things is hard

Applications need custom content

CoffeeScript is bad

SPAs are the future

Rails is slow

Nokigiri is the worst thing to install


### Convention is dead!
### Long live configuration!
### Long live microframeworks!

![NodeJS](images/node.jpg)


## And it was great!

Note:
Microservices became easy to write

Asyncronous code provided real benefits

WebSockets are easy and fast


## But...

Note:
Asynchronous code often lead to callback hell

JavaScript isn't the best language out there

Can only use one thread at a time

CRUD generation is worse than Rails


### We need a solution that...

allows someone to easily write a microservice

also has support for easy CRUD

has great library support

can easily do anything needed
